# Data Analysis with Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the Data Analysis with Python course. These projects demonstrate a solid foundational knowledge of data analysis using Python.

## Projects Included

### 1. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
   - Description: This project involved implementing a calculator that calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a given dataset. It showcases the ability to perform basic statistical calculations using Python.

### 2. Demographic Data Analyzer
   - Description: In this project, demographic data is analyzed to extract various insights. It includes tasks such as calculating the number of individuals from each race, determining the average age of men, and analyzing the percentage of people with advanced education earning above a certain income threshold. It demonstrates skills in data manipulation, aggregation, and exploration using pandas and numpy libraries.

### 3. Medical Data Visualizer
   - Description: This project focuses on visualizing medical data to draw meaningful conclusions. It involves tasks such as creating box plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to analyze factors such as age, blood pressure, and BMI in relation to various medical conditions. It showcases the ability to create informative visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas libraries.

### 4. Page View Time Series Visualizer
   - Description: In this project, time series data for website page views is analyzed and visualized. It includes tasks such as calculating monthly page views, visualizing page view distributions, and identifying the dates with the highest and lowest page views. It demonstrates skills in working with time series data, data cleaning, and creating visualizations using pandas and matplotlib.

### 5. Sea Level Predictor
   - Description: This project involves analyzing and predicting sea level rise based on given data. It includes tasks such as cleaning the data, performing linear regression analysis, and visualizing the predicted sea level rise. It showcases skills in data preprocessing, linear regression, and visualization using numpy, pandas, and matplotlib libraries.

Each project is accompanied by a detailed explanation and the code used to perform the analysis. The projects provide practical examples of data analysis techniques using Python and offer insights into different domains such as statistics, demographics, healthcare, web analytics, and environmental analysis.
